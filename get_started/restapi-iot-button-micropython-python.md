# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect teXXmo IoT Button device running micropython with Azure IoT Hub. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Configure the device and run the IoT sample

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   teXXmo IoT Button device.
-   6 x AAA battery. These are special 3V AAA batteries.  
-   1 x USB to Serial Adapter. This is to flash FW.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

Flash Instructions

-   Install Python
-   Install esptool
        Pip install esptool
-	Run esptool.  
            esptool --port <COM Port> --baud 115200 write_flash --flash_mode dout --flash_size 1MB --flash_freq 20m 0x00000 backup127.img
-   You can also use flash.cmd by specifying COM port.E.g. flash.cmd com5
-   FW (ver 1.27), Source Code, and a few other files are in \\scratch2\scratch\daisuken\teXXmo\127

# Step 3: Run the sample

## 3.1 Configure the Azure IoT settings

-   Hold power button for 5 sec. LEC chanes from Green Flash to Yellow, then Red flash.When LED flashes in RED, the device is in AP Mode.  
-   From any desktop machine, connect to the device via WiFi using the SSID : ESP_<Last 3 digits of MAC Address>.

### 3.2 Send Telemetry to IoT Hub Sample:

-	Single Click (more like short press rather than click) the power button. This will send message to IoT Hub. See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.
